Welcome to dot2tex's documentation!
===================================

The purpose of dot2tex is to give graphs generated by Graphviz a more LaTeX
friendly look and feel. This is accomplished by converting xdot output from
Graphviz to a series of PSTricks or PGF/TikZ commands. This approach allows:

    * Typesetting labels with LaTeX, allowing mathematical notation.
    * Using native PSTricks and PGF/TikZ commands for drawing arrows (optional).
    * Using backend specific styles to customize the output
